		<p class="p2">Retribution is a western that deals with the differences between what is legally right and what is morally right.  It deals with a time that is surrounded by change but seems to be as stagnate as ever.  It focuses on themes and issues that are still examined by society today: law, the judicial system, race, firearms, violence and justice.</p>
		<p class="p3">How do you decide...law or retribution?<br/><br/>RETRIBUTION is the new feature western from Archlight Studios and Pirate Pictures.  The film is currently in development after having shot an extensive test reel.</p>
